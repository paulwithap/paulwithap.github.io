A while back, I installed Ubuntu on my old, shitty Dell laptop (it's actually the same age as my Macbook). For some reason, I only created an 8GB partition on the drive for Ubuntu, and before long, ran out of space.

I never use the Windows Vista installation I have on the rest of the hard drive, and didn't see any reason to keep it, so I did the smart, simple thing and just deleted the partition. There were also some weird, Dell-installed partitions that didn't seem to be doing me any good, so I deleted those as well. Lightning didn't strike me out of my computer chair, so I thought I was in the clear.

Then, I left my Dell unplugged for a while, because I needed the outlet, and it died. When I tried starting it up, I got a lovely welcome message:
    BOOTMGR is missing
    Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart

I've spent a bit of time googling now, and the simplest solution seems to be to boot with a Ubuntu Live CD. Unfortunately, my disc drive on my Macbook has been broken for years, and until now I haven't had a single use for it. So, my next option is to boot from a USB drive.

Sort of embarrassingly, I'm not 100% sure how to create a bootable USB drive for a PC on a Mac. From what I gather, it should be in FAT format, which is all fine and dandy, except when I reformat my drive to FAT, I can't seem to drop files on it from my Mac.

My plan now, is to create a drive using Ubuntu on a VirtualBox on my Mac. I expect interacting with a USB device from VirtualBox will prove to be a giant pain in the ass.

Stay tuned for more failures and frustrations.

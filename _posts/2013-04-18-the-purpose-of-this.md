So, this probably should have been the first post, but Lorem Ipsum got that honor. And that test post will remain here until I figure out how to properly use the Javascript snippet Disqus gave me to display commment counts.

Anywho, this blog is here mainly to serve as a journal for my adventures in coding and anything else computer related. The posts will be mostly about problems I encounter while learning new things, and hopefully solutions to those problems. It's more for me than anyone else, but if some fellow noob finds one of my posts and it helps them solve their problem, then they owe me $5 and can send it via Paypal to pjaworski@gmail.com (for tax purposes please say it is a gift).

I also hope that just the act of writing these things out will both clarify my thoughts and improve my atrocious writing. One of the benefits of going to college is all those papers I missed out on writing.

On a completely different topic, I've noticed that 15% of the traffic to this site is coming from China, which is significant, considering I don't know anyone in China, and the majority of traffic here is from LA - where I do know a couple people.

If you're in China and reading this, please leave a comment and let me know what brought you here.
